The classes in this folder are part of My Framework build and based on the Zend
Framework. The classes usually either extensions to Zend classes or expect one 
or more Zend classes to be available with autoloader.

Some classes may be used without the Zend Framework after a few minor changes 
but this is not and will not be documented as the classes in this repository
are strictly used within this project and framework. Feel free to copy such
classes and create your own class but some credit is certainly appreciated.
