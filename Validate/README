The files in this folder are my validation classes with validators not 
available or found in the Zend libary. As all classes in the Zend_Awd they 
all directly or indirectly extend to a Zend class which in this case most 
likely is Zend_Validate_Abstract.

*  About Validators  *
**********************
From the Zend documentation page "Zend_Validate - Introduction" at
http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.validate.introduction.html

The Zend_Validate component provides a set of commonly needed validators. It 
also provides a simple validator chaining mechanism by which multiple validators
may be applied to a single datum in a user-defined order.
 
A validator examines its input with respect to some requirements and produces 
a boolean result - whether the input successfully validates against the 
requirements. If the input does not meet the requirements, a validator may 
additionally provide information about which requirement(s) the input does 
not meet.
